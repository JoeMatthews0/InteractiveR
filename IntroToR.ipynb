        "\n",
        "In R we add annotations/comments to our code using the `#` symbol.

While these types exist in R, for almost all practical purposes we never need to worry about the distinction ourselves, and so we can just think of all numbers as being `numeric` type.\n",
        "\n",
        "The type of a variable determines how it behaves and what we can do with it. For example we can do standard mathematical operations like addition and multiplication on `numeric` objects, which we can't do with `character` objects. Conversely, `numeric` objects can only contain numeric digits 0-9, whereas `character` objects can be made up of numbers, letters or special characters.\n",

        "Defining `character` objects is easy, they are anything that are surrounded by quote marks `\"\"`, so `\"Joe\"`, \"`Nice to meet you`\", `\"Ant & Dec\"` would all be valid character objects in R. This even applies to numbers if contained in quote marks. You can check if an object is of type `numeric` using the `is.numeric` command\n",

        "\n",
        "**Note:** As you may have noticed from the code chunks so far, we do not need to declare the type of a variable when we create it, R will define the variable type based on what we input. This is an example of the flexibility that makes R a friendlier language for beginners compared to some other languages, but also means we need to be careful ourselves to make sure that we don't introduce bugs in our code through variables being a different type to what we intend etc.\n",

        "### Common Pitfalls with R Variables\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Usually when we're working with data, we'll be dealing with groups of data points rather than just single observations. To collect values together in R, we use the `c()` command, which stands for `concatenate`, where we include the individual objects we want to combine separated by commas. The resulting object is often called a vector or a 2D array.\n",

In this course we look to work with data in a **tidy** format, where each row represents a new individual, and each column represents a new variable, and so the number of rows in our data should equal the number of individuals, and the number of columns should equal the number of variables.
